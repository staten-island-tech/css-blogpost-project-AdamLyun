          group of eight people, who choose city names as their aliases, to
          carry out an ambitious plan that involves entering the Royal Mint of
          Spain, and escaping with €984 million. After taking 67 people hostage
          inside the Mint, the team plans to remain inside for 11 days to print
          the money as they deal with elite police forces. In the events
          following the initial heist, the group's members are forced out of
          hiding and prepare for a second heist, with some additional members,
          this time aiming to escape with gold from the Bank of Spain, as they
          again deal with hostages and police forces." - Wikipedia

          "Seong Gi-hun, a divorced father and indebted gambler who lives with
          his elderly mother, is invited to play a series of children's games
          for a chance at a large cash prize. Accepting the offer, he is taken
          to an unknown location where he finds himself among 455 other players
          who are all in deep financial trouble. The players are made to wear
          green tracksuits and are kept under watch at all times by masked
          guards in pink jumpsuits, with the games overseen by the Front Man,
          who wears a black mask and black uniform. The players soon discover
          that losing a game results in their death, with each death adding ₩100
          million to the potential ₩45.6 billion grand prize. Gi-hun allies with
          other players, including his childhood friend Cho Sang-woo and North
          Korean defector Kang Sae-byeok, to try to survive the physical and
          psychological twists of the games." - Wikipedia

          "The story follows professional thief Assane Diop, the only son of an
          immigrant from Senegal who had come to France to seek a better life
          for his child. Assane's father is framed for the theft of an expensive
          diamond necklace by his employer, the wealthy and powerful Hubert
          Pellegrini, and hangs himself in his prison cell out of shame, leaving
          the teenage Assane an orphan. Twenty-five years later, inspired by a
          book about gentleman thief Arsène Lupin his father had given him on
          his birthday, Assane sets out to get revenge on the Pellegrini family,
          using his charisma and mastery of thievery, subterfuge, and disguise
          to expose Hubert's crimes" - Wikipedia
